# Tensorflow MNIST

## Goal

Train a model on [the MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) using Tensorflow and Keras.

## Getting Started

```shell
# Create a virtual environment named "ml" (if not already created).
python -m venv ml

# Activate your virtual environment (if using Windows).
.\ml\Scripts\activate

# Add ipykernal to allow Jupyter use your virtual environment.
# Note that when using VS Code, Jupyter is not required to be installed in the virtual environment.

pip install ipykernel
```
